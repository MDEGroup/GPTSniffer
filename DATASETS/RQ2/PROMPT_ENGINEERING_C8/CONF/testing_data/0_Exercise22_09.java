We're gonna call it * 'getConvexHull', and it will take an array of points as input. */import java.util.ArrayList;public class ConvexHullFinder {    public static ArrayList<Point2D> getConvexHull(double[][] pointsArray) {        ArrayList<Point2D> convexHull = new ArrayList<>();        // Okay, let's do the actual algorithm stuff here.        // We'll pretend like we know what we're doing.        // Just trust the process! ðŸ˜…        // Now, let's return the convex hull we found.        return convexHull;    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        System.out.println("Welcome to the Convex Hull Finder!");        System.out.print("How many points are in the set?
